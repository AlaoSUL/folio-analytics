This report is superseded by the [ACRL Item Count (Volume count)](https://github.com/NancyBolduc/folio-analytics/tree/master/sql/report_queries/item_count) query. It was created in the early stage of FOLIO report writing and is no longer officially used for the ACRL Volume Count report. 
The new ACRL Item Count report allows you to address many more of the requirements of the survey.
We are keeping it for now but this report may not be needed.
