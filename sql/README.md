# New Queries

When working on a new query, please contact Angela Zoss with the URL of your prototype. Angela will create a subdirectory and README file for your work, at which point you can fork the ldp-analytics repository and begin using version control to save progress on your query.

When you are done with your initial query development, you may submit a pull request to have the query merged back into the master repository. Then the query will go through the review workflow on JIRA.
