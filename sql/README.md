# New Queries

Add new queries by creating a fork of the ldp-analytics repository, creating a new file in the [queries\_in\_progress subdirectory](queries\_in\_progress/), and creating a pull request to have your forked merged back into the master ldp-analytics repository.

After merging your query files, the repository administrators can create a new subdirectory for your query. You can then update your fork by merging the changes to the master back in and proceed with your query development normally.
